âš¡ Grid Connection Optimization for E-Truck Charging Hubs
Cost-optimal planning of electric grid connections for high-power charging infrastructure used in heavy-duty electric truck (BE-LKW) hubs in Germany.

This project models the complex trade-offs between cable sizing, transformer selection, battery storage integration, and grid connection types â€” to minimize infrastructure investment costs while meeting high-performance demands.

ðŸ§  What This Repo Does
This repo builds a multi-step optimization pipeline that:

Estimates site-specific charging demand

Calculates grid connection options (MV/HV substations, distances, constraints)

Models investment costs (cables, transformers, batteries)

Optimizes the entire charging hub layout using linear programming
